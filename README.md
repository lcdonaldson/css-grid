# CSS GRID EXAMPLES
CSS Grid has changed the way I design things for the better.
While Grid is not new at this point, it is to date one of the best concepts for designing fully responsive websites and apps.

CSS Grid is the best choice for fully responsive customizable layouts on the web. Mobile applications however, I still need to rely on flexbox or native android ios and window styling.
